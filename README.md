Abstract:

The human visual system (HVS) utilizes cone photoreceptors for photopic (high  
light level) vision.  It is well known that the distribution of cones in the  
HVS is not uniform, but rather non-uniform which has often been modeled as a  
conformal logarithmic mapping. When the distribution of cone photoreceptors is  
mapped to a logarithmic polar (log-polar) coordinate space, it is noted that  
the density of cone photoreceptors follows the axis rho (the axis moving  
outwards from the center). This concentration of cone photoreceptors allows a  
high resolution of pertinent data at the foveal point while still maintaining  
a wide periphery of under sampled data.  By applying the same techniques that  
the human visual system utilizes to interpret real-time data, we hope to  
achieve an efficient image processing algorithm which can be converted into  
an easily parsed format for machine interpretation. This project is a  
component of a larger research effort by Professor Richard A. Messner to  
study the processing channels that occur in a afferent portion of the HVS.
